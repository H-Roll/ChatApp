# Chat App!

This app was developed for a class project and offers a range of functionalities for users. Registered users can log in, create and participate in chats, with updates reflected instantly on other users' devices. Guests have limited access, allowing them only to view existing chats and chatrooms.

To run the app on your phone, first ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Then in your IDE run npm install, then run npm start. Download the "Expo Go" app from the app store to easily view and interact with the chat app on your device by scanning the QR code made in the terminal.
