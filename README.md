# Chat App!

This app was developed for a class project and offers a range of functionalities for users. Registered users can log in, create and participate in chats, with updates reflected instantly on other users' devices. Guests have limited access, allowing them only to view existing chats and chatrooms.

To run the app on your phone, ensure you have Node.js installed. Additionally, consider downloading the "Expo Go" app to easily view and interact with the chat app on your device.
